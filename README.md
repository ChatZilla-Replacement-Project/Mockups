# Mockups
This is where we storing proposed mockups.  It will probably never contain code.  Once we start coding, it will be updated less and less.

# Where to put mockups you come up with
Official mockups go in the root.  If an organization owner hasn't accepted the mockup as the plan, put them into a folder with your name on it.
